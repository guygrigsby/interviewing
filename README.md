# Developer

## Design
What to look for (Level based)
Junior: (Flexible based on experience, not sure entry level will know much design at all)
- Basic components (Front end, API, Backend) 
Mid:
- REST
- HTTP Methods
- Interfaces
- Asynch possibility
Senior:
- Fault tolerance (big focus)
  - durability vs simplicity
- Scalability
  - Hash director
  - horizontal vs vertical scaling
- Partial failure management
- CAP Theorem (trade-offs)


### The Bitly question
Design bitly. Detail should increase as level of position increases. All higher positions include requirements for lower
eng1-eng2 (may or may not apply)
  - hash
  - endpoints
  - db
eng3
  - 
eng4
  -
eng5+

### Facebook image processing

## Coding
### Palindrome

### Numeric complement
Given an array of integers, return an array of values where the original array contained both the integer and it's complement.
Example:
```
Input: [1,2,9,-1,-9]
Output: [1,9]
```
Look for:
- edge cases
- not necessarily best, but iterative solution
- time complexity
- space complexity

## Competencies

### Leadership
- Given a team without software engineering and design principles, how can you help people to understand best practices.
- Tell me about a time that your org experienced a lot of churn. How did you handle it?
- Tell me about an idea you had that improved the company in some way. How did you get it implemented?
- Tell me about an idea you had that got a lot of resistance from the team. What happened? Did your idea win?

# SDET

## Coding questions
See above

## Basics
- Threads
  - mutexes / semaphores
  - communication between
    - race conditions
    - shared memory

## Testing

### Networking
- HTTP Methods and uses
- UDP/TCP

### Frameworks
- Used, liked, disliked
- Feelings on manual testing

### Types of testing
- Experience with
- Known, but not used (why not used?)

## Competencies
- Talk about a time that there was a conflict with dev. How was it resolved?
